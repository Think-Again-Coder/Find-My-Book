# Book Search Engine ðŸ“– 

## Week 21 Challenge - Find My Book

---
## *Description:* 

This full-stack(MERN) application was created to give the user a way to search for their favorite books and create a login with password. The user can search for new books or login to find a library of their own collection.   


## *Process:*

This was the first attempt at using all M.E.R.N technology (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to create a complete application. 

A notable feature is the ability to use the Google Books API as the search engine bult as a RESTful API. This is refactored to be a GraphQL API with Apollo Server code. 

The front end is built using React.js along with the rest of the MERN stack. The images here represents an example of the searches for "computer programming" books with 10 results.

### Summary: 

This is a great application for book lovers or anyone looking to take advantage ot the Google Books API for a large library of books. The mongoDB account was established along with the mojority of the code needed to pull results but the Heroku deployment was a challenge I couldn't overcome. I look forward to returning to this to complete.
